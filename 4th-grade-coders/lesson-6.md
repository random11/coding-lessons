## Lesson: 
We're going to learn how to use variables and clones to shoot the penguin with a snowball


## Coding
* Create a snowball shooter
* Create a snowball
* Create a penguin (alive and dead costumes)

### Shoot a bullet
When space bar is pressed, clone a snowball.
When a new clone comes out, make it move until it hits the penguin or the side
If the bullet touches the penguin, make the penguin hit with the snowball

### Point it with variables
How do we point the bullet in the direction we want to go?
First, let's point the gun whereever the mouse is pointing
Second, save the x position, y position, and direction of the gun into variables
Third, let's set the xposition, yposition and direction of the bullet
